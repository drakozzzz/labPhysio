        "# Procedures\n",
        "1. Add just enough litmus powder to a container of dairy cream to produce a medium blue\n",
        "color. Pour 3 ml of the litmus cream into 4 separate test tubes. Into two additional test tubes\n",
        "pour 3 ml of 2% pancreatin. Preincubate the litmus cream and the pancreatin separately in a 37\n",

        "2. Gently shake each tube for 30 seconds to mix in the bile salts. Incubate all four tubes in a 37\n",
        "C water bath for 1 hour, checking every minute for the first 5 minutes or until the first tube\n",

        "the tube. Continue checking for the remainder of the hour.\n",
